# On-the-job-ticket-accessibility-challenge

*This is an on the job ticket accessibility project which sought to add semantics to a webpage to make it easier for users to relate well with the page *

# Challenges 
Inputting in the semantics altered the some of output of the webpage making it look different from the original page. However, with modifictions in html and css, the page now resembled the original page
 
 
# Things I learned
I was able to apply semantics to the webpage and learnt new semantic terms that hitherto i was not familiar with. I was able to explore with the postioin property in css
